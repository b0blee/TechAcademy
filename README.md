# TechAcademy

The Technical Academy consists of algorithms that play musical compositions.  Version 1 was  written in Forth on the Atari 1040 ST in 1990-91 using Forthmacs and ForMuLa, and released on private label cassette. That music is now available from Fixture Records at http://www.fixture-records.com/b0b.html#technical, and the Forth source is archived at https://github.com/b0blee/4thAcademy.

This Ruby code is based on the original Forth code.  New compositions include:

Do Thing - dothing.rb - the original algorithm has been reimplemented in Ruby, and then modified to use the Bohlen-Pierce chromatic scale and play each section at a different tempo.  You can hear the result at http://soundhost.net/2016/03/a-bunch-of-god-damn-noise/

Drum Jam - drumbot.rb was ported from Forth, then augmented with sounds from Roland's SN-U110-10 "Rock Drums" data card. It's a 5/4 random drummer duet. Three performances can be heard at http://soundhost.net/2016/03/drum-jam/

Rehearsal Room - rehearse.rb is a program used to test the system and the hardware synthesizers. You can hear one of the tests at http://bp.b0b.com/2016/03/rehearsal-room/

Not In C - notinc.rb reimagines Terry Riley's "In C" using a variation of the Bohlen-Pierce Moll I mode (the 9th tone J is flatted).  Two premature performances of the algorithm can be heard at http://bp.b0b.com/2016/03/in-odd/
