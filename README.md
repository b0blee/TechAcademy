# TechAcademy

The Technical Academy consists of algorithms that play musical compositions.  Version 1 was  written in Forth on the Atari 1040 ST in 1990-91 using Forthmacs and ForMuLa, and released on private label cassette. That music is now available from Fixture Records at http://www.fixture-records.com/b0b.html#technical, and the Forth source is archived at https://github.com/b0blee/4thAcademy.

This Ruby code is based on the original Forth code.  New compositions include:

Do Thing - the original algorithm has been reimplemented in Ruby, and then modified to use the Bohlen-Pierce chromatic scale and play each section at a different tempo.  You can hear the result at http://soundhost.net/2016/03/a-bunch-of-god-damn-noise/

In Odd - this new work reimagines Terry Riley's "In C" using a variation of the Bohlen-Pierce Moll I mode (the 9th tone J is flatted).  Two performances of the algorithm can be heard at http://bp.b0b.com/2016/03/in-odd/
